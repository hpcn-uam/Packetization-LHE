# LHE (FPGA edition) transmitter/receiver and player

## Description

This project provides an implementation of a transmitter/receiver and player for [Logarithmical hopping encoding (LHE)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166450 "LHE @ IET Image Processing"). This implementation has been developed at HPCN-UAM, in the context of the [Racing Drones project](http://www.hpcn-uam.es/project/racing-drones/ "Racing Drones @ HPCN-UAM"). Current version is compatible with the [FPGA-powered LHE implementation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8533522).
